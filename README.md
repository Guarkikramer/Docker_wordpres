# Docker_wordpres
Repository to use WordPress with mysql using docker. with a very simple configuration. replacement for xampp or lampp. 


we will use this command to install and deploy the wordpress environment:
    
<span style="color:red">docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d</span>


docker-compose = tools used to use multiple containers .
-f = we specify the file that we are going to lift
 up = start the server 
-d = run the container in the background
